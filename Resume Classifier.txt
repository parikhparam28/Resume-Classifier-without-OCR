Resume Classifier: Visual Image Classification
Dataset Details:
* Dataset: Mixed collection of resume and non-resume images scrapped from Google images using the BeautifulSoup library
* Organization: Manually segregated into 'resume' and 'non-resume' categories.
* Size: Balanced representation for effective model training using training, testing, and validation set. 
* Training Size: Used 178 resume images and 360 non-resume images
* Testing Size: Used 33 resume images and 66 non-resume images
Model Architecture:
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   * Input: Images resized to a uniform size (150x150).
   * Layers: Conv2D(5), MaxPooling2D(5), Flatten, Dropout, Dense(2).
   * Activation: ReLU for hidden layers, Sigmoid for output layer (binary classification).
Training Strategy:
* Data Augmentation:
   * Applied via ImageDataGenerator to increase dataset diversity.
   * Techniques: Rotation, shifting, flipping, shear, rescaling, normalization, etc.
* Regularization: L2 regularizer used to prevent overfitting
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
* Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy.
* Epochs: 25 (Adjusted based on validation performance to prevent overfitting)
Evaluation Metrics:
* Precision: 0.8 (Measure of accurately predicted positives)
* Recall: 1.0 (Proportion of actual positives identified correctly)
* F1-score: 0.88 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balance)
Results & Insights:
* Performance: Achieved good precision and recall rates (>=80%).
* Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of model's classification accuracy  [[ 5, 1 ], [0, 4]]
Conclusion:
* Successfully developed a visual-based resume classifier using CNN.
* Achieved robust performance metrics without utilizing OCR or textual features.
